# Bink exercise

A python exercise for Bink

## Local setup

Clone the project and navigate into the root folder, run `pipenv shell`

## Running the project

Run `python analysis` to see my answers

Run `pytest` to run my tests

## NB Data normalisation

The values for "Tenant Name" are unnormalised. I wasn't clear if the instructions had asked me to leave them in this state or otherwise. I considered writing a function to clean the small number of tenant names found in this test dataset, but the function would not easily extend to use on a real-life dataset. Let me know, and I can write said function asap.

# Bink exercise

A python exercise for Bink

## Local setup

Clone the project and navigate into the root folder, run `pipenv shell`

## Running the project

Run `python analysis` to see my answers

Run `pytest` to run my tests

## Data normalisation
The values for "Tenant Name" are curently unnormalised. I wasn't entirely clear if the instructions had asked me to leave it in this state or otherwise. I considered writing a function to clean the data, which would have been easy to do for this small dataset, but would not have been extendable to a real-life dataset.
